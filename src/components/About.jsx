  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm <strong>Venkata Eswar</strong>, a passionate and dedicated <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning.
    I love building modern, scalable web applications using the power of both frontend and backend technologies.
  </p>

  <p>
    My tech journey started with a deep interest in Java and gradually evolved into full-stack development. Today, I'm confident in building complex web systems using
    <strong> React.js</strong> on the frontend and <strong>Spring Boot</strong> on the backend, with <strong>MySQL</strong> as the database layer.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve worked on several real-world projects like an <strong>E-commerce platform</strong> with user authentication, order management, payment gateway integration (Razorpay).
    I'm also familiar with building RESTful APIs, using JWT for secure authentication, and deploying apps on platforms like <strong>AWS</strong>, Vercel and GitHub Pages.
  </p>

  <p>
    Apart from coding, I’m always learning — whether it’s DevOps tools, cloud platforms like AWS, or improving system design concepts.
    My goal is to become a top-tier full-stack engineer who not only builds apps but understands business needs and delivers real value.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm open to internships and collaborative projects where I can apply my skills and learn from like-minded professionals.
    If you're looking for someone who’s driven, curious, and serious about growth, let’s connect!
